## üìå Your Job Portal Project - Key Talking Points

### **Project Overview** 
"I built a full-stack job portal web application that connects job seekers with employers. It's like a mini LinkedIn Jobs where users can register as either job seekers or employers, post jobs, apply for positions, and manage their applications."

### **Technical Architecture**
```
Frontend: React.js + TypeScript + Mantine UI + Redux Toolkit
Backend: Spring Boot + Spring Security + JWT Authentication  
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)
```

### **Key Features I Implemented**

#### For Job Seekers:
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based secure login/registration
- **Job Search & Filtering**: Search by location, job type, experience level
- **Application Management**: Apply for jobs with resume upload
- **Dashboard**: Track application status and job history

#### For Employers:
- **Job Posting**: Create, edit, and delete job listings with rich text editor
- **Applicant Management**: View and manage job applications
- **Company Profile**: Showcase company information and culture

### **Technical Challenges Solved**

1. **Authentication & Security**
   - "I implemented JWT-based authentication with Spring Security to ensure secure user sessions"
   - "Used role-based access control to differentiate between job seekers and employers"

2. **State Management**
   - "Used Redux Toolkit for efficient state management across the application"
   - "Implemented proper data flow for user authentication state"

3. **API Integration**
   - "Built RESTful APIs with proper error handling and validation"
   - "Implemented Axios interceptors for automatic token management"

4. **User Experience**
   - "Used Mantine UI library for consistent, professional design"
   - "Implemented responsive design with TailwindCSS"
   - "Added rich text editor for job descriptions using TipTap"

### **Live Demo Points**
- **Frontend**: [job-portal.vercel.app](https://job-portal.vercel.app)
- **Backend API**: [job-portal-backend.onrender.com](https://job-portal-backend.onrender.com)
